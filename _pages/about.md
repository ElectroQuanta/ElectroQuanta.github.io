Hi, I am an mechatronics engineer, which loves to code, build, tinker, and hack xD.

I started out as by completing a Mechanical Engineering MSc at University of
Minho in the end of 2014.
However, soon after that, I was challenged to build and program a novel
multi-material 3D printing machine using Selective Laser Sintering/Melting
(SLS/M). I quickly realized this was a major oportunity to learn and grow, but I
also aware of my lack of expertise in some areas.

Thus, soon after I enrolled in the Mechatronics Engineering MSc, which I
completed in 2019 with a course grade of 18/20. This course provided me with the
grounding foundations to achieve the envisioned goals and in MSc my thesis I
presented the first version of a 3D printing machine using SLS/SLM, but mono
material only. I was responsible for the electronics design, firmware
development and for the development of a workflow and toolchain to slice and
print the 3D parts. Not only was I able to fulfill the goals I have set my mind
to, with a working equipment and accompanying toolchain, as I got recognition
for my MSc thesis with 20/20.

These results paved the way to pursue my PhD in Mechanical Engineering,
upgrading the equipment to process multiple materials, enabling 3D functional
design of components such as biomedical and aeronautical ones. This requirement
also led to the need for multi-laser actuation, as the different materials have
different absortion wavelengths. New and more complex challenges emerged and
forced me to once again upgrade my skill set, and thus I pursued simultaneously
my MSc in Industrial Eletronics and Computers Engineering. At the end of 2023 I
got my PhD entitled "Functional design and Manufacturing of
3D multi-material structures using SLS/SLM". I further improved my SW and HW
design skills, as proven by the multi-material multi-laser equipment, a
multi-material preprocessing and post-processing SW toolchain, and the low-level firmware.

Currently, I am finishing my MSc in Industrial Electronics and Computers
Engineering. I also work at the DTx Laboratory in UMinho, where I develop
virtualization solutions for UAV applications to improve their security against
ill-intentioned attacks.
